# 30daysJsChallenge-Slide-In-on-Scroll.
Day 13 of the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge: Slide-In-on-Scroll. Learned how to implement a debouncing function to optimize the performance of a scroll-triggered image animation ("slide-in" effect) in a web page. This ensures smoother animations by limiting the frequency of function calls during scrolling.
